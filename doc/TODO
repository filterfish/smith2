* Fix bug where an agent is not shut down properly when multiple agents
  are stopped simultaneously.

* Use caller instead of exception so I don't get a reference to the
  bootstrap class. Not sure how to format it though.

* Ensure that if an agent is in a die/restart loop that when the agent
  is stopped it is removed from the run list.

* Add check to see if the agent actually exists.

* Add kill all to the kill option. Like stop all.
